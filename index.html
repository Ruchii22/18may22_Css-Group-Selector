        <h1>Grouping Selector</h1>
        <h3>Often, it happens that some or many elements of a HTML follow same style.</h3>
        <h4>Instead of writing separate code for each & element you can group the selectors.</h4>
        <h3>Each selector should be separated by a comma. 
            By doing this we can also minimize the code.</h3>
